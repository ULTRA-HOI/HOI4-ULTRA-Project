 FIN_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "The first armoured units were created in the 1920s when Finland, outside a few captured ex-Russian armoured cars, purchased in France 26 Renault FT tanks in 1919-21 (see later) which formed the first two battalions of tanks. A few were lent early one to the white Russian fighting in the North Western threater."
 FIN_light_tank_equipment_1:0 "Vickers Mark E"
 FIN_light_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Vickers Mk. E"
 FIN_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 " Very close to the Vickers 6-tons, they shared similar components. T-26s were the most abundant of any soviet tanks and the most were captured in the winter war. 47 were repaired of which 34 were pressed into the front line, midly appreciated since their engine was more reliable than the Vickers model. Some T-26A (twin turreted) and OT-26s were converted with spare 45 mm armed turrets, but eventually their service time was limited and most had been retired at the end of the summer 1941."

 FIN_light_tank_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "Properly speaking these were captured BT-7 modified to carry a Finnish 114 mm howitzer in a custom-built superstructure. Top heavy and unstable, the BT-42s proved unable to penetrate the thick sloped armour of standard soviet tanks in 1942."

 FIN_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The most prolific tank of all time was not available before the end of the Winter War, therefore like the KV-1, almost all captured were so in 1941-42 and of the corresponding types. However some T-34/85s were also captured."

 FIN_modern_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The British 11th Armoured Division was the first formation to receive the new tanks—deliveries commenced in December 1944—and the only division to be completely refitted by the end of the war. Due to its late arrival in the war in north west Europe, the Comet did not participate in big battles, although it was used in combat. The Comet was involved in the crossing of the Rhine and the later Berlin Victory Parade in July 1945. The Comet's maximum speed of 32 miles per hour (51 km/h) was greatly exploited on the German Autobahns."
