 burma.3.t:0 "Replacement of the Governor of Burma"
 burma.3.d:0 "Following the transition of government away from the Premiership of Neville Chamberlain, the new Prime Minister has deemed it necessary to reappoint many existing ministers. The Minister of Agriculture, Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith, has served his country well, having worked to improve the heavily criticised agricultural policies. Dorman-Smith had instigated the Dig for Victory campaign in late 1940, which aimed to increase the food production from allotments. Now an out-going minister, having been replaced by Robert Hudson, we should find a fitting post for him. \n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, Dorman-Smith made a speech in 1939 to the East India Association, lamenting the fact that while the British had talked for years about self-government and reform in Asia, they had delivered very little of it which had damaged their credibility 'Neither our word nor our intentions are trusted in that part of the globe ... We have fed such countries as Burma on political formulae until they are sick at the very sight and sound of a formula, which has come, as far as my experience shows, to be looked upon as a very British means of avoiding a definite course of action.'"
