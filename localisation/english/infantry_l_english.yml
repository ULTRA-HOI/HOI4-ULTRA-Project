 infantry_guns_smg_desc: "During World War I, submachine guns (SMGs) were introduced as a new type of firearm for close-quarters combat. These weapons fired pistol ammunition, such as the 9mm Parabellum cartridge, and had a relatively low rate of fire, usually around 500-600 rounds per minute. WW1 era SMGs were made of metal and wood, and were simple and rugged in design, intended to be easy to use and maintain on the battlefield. They were a significant advancement in firearms technology, providing soldiers with a more effective weapon for close-range combat than the traditional bolt-action rifles of the time."

 DESIGNER_HELP_TEXT: "General Principles:\n- Adding additional members to a squad decreases its overall efficiency.\n- The Squad Leader, NCO, and any specialists (such as a machine gunner or marksman) do not contribute significantly to the squad's hit points. Normal line units are essential.\n- The Squad Leader and NCO slots double the defense and breakthrough bonuses of SMGs or assault rifles.\n- General purpose machine guns have a greater impact on a squad's efficiency than lighter LMGs."
