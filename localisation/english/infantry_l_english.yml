WW1 era SMGs were made of metal and wood, and were simple and rugged in design, intended to be easy to use and maintain on the battlefield. They were a significant advancement in firearms technology, providing soldiers with a more effective weapon for close-range combat than the traditional bolt-action rifles of the time."

 infantry_guns_assault_rifle_desc: "Assault rifles are a type of firearm that is designed for use in close-quarters combat and other short-range shooting situations. They are characterized by their intermediate cartridge, which allows assault rifles to be more compact and lightweight than traditional rifles, while still providing sufficient power and accuracy for medium-range shooting. They are versatile weapons that can be used in a wide range of situations, including close-quarters combat, urban warfare, and other scenarios."

However, they were large and heavy, have significant recoil, and were expensive to produce and maintain. They also have lower reliability compared to other types of firearms, such as assault rifles or submachine guns. Despite these issues, early battle rifles have several advantages that make them valuable tools."

 DESIGNER_HELP_TEXT: "General Principles:\n- Adding additional members to a squad decreases its overall efficiency.\n- The Squad Leader, NCO, and any specialists (such as a machine gunner or marksman) do not contribute significantly to the squad's hit points. Normal line units are essential.\n- The Squad Leader and NCO slots double the defense and breakthrough bonuses of SMGs or assault rifles.\n- General purpose machine guns have a greater impact on a squad's efficiency than lighter LMGs."
