    ger_fighter_equipment_0_desc:0 "The He-51 was an early 1930s conventional single-bay biplane, with all-metal construction and fabric covering. Armed with two 7.92mm MG-17 nose-mounted machine guns, it was Germany's last majorly produced biplane fighter design. It served in the Spanish Civil war and later as a trainer."

    GER_ger_fighter_equipment_1:0 "Messerschmitt Bf-109 B-1"
    ger_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "A mid-1930s all-metal monoplane fighter design, the Messerschmitt Bf-109 became Germany's most produced fighter in World War 2. While the initial armament of two nose-mounted 7.92mm MG-17 machine guns was rather weak, its impressive speed gave it a huge advantage, even breaking the world air speed record in 1937. However, a big drawback is its tiny operational range, which may prove to be a significant problem in the future."

    ger_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Bf-109 E ('Emil') was the first major variant, receiving a stronger engine, better airframe, and two wing-mounted 7.92mm MG-17 machine guns. These were soon replaced on the E-3 with 20mm MG FF cannons, making the 'Emil' arguably the deadliest fighter in Europe at the time."

    GER_ger_fighter_equipment_3:0 "Messerschmitt Bf 109 F-4 'Friedrich'"
    ger_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "Often considered the best version, the Bf-109 F ('Friedrich') exchanged the two wing-mounted 20mm MG FF cannons for the better single 20mm MG 151 cannon firing through the propeller hub, which became the standard configuration for all subsequent variants. The new engine and airframe ensured it retained the edge over most opponents."

    ger_fighter_equipment_4_desc:0 "The Bf-109 G ('Gustav') was initially just a Bf-109 F with a stronger but less reliable engine, however, it was soon modified to deal with the increasing American bomber threat. The two nose-mounted 7.92mm MG-17 machine guns were replaced with two 13mm MG 131 machine guns, increasing the firepower but also the weight. The Bf-109 G-6 was the most produced single variant of the Bf-109 series with just over 11,700 produced."

    ger_fighter_equipment_6_desc:0 "The Focke-Wulf 190 A-2 ('Anton') first flew in late 1939 and was introduced into service in 1941. At the time of its introduction, it outclassed all of its opponents in the East and the West. It was powered by the BMW 801 C-1 engine, which had some significant reliability problems in the beginning. The aircraft is armed with two 20mm MG FF/M cannons supported by four 7.92mm MG 17s (two nose-mounted and two in the wing roots.)"

    GER_ger_fighter_equipment_7:0 "Focke-Wulf Fw190 A-3 'Anton'"
    ger_fighter_equipment_7_desc:0 "This variant would become the baseline model for the 'Anton' series. The 1540hp BMW 801 C-1 engine was replaced by the 1700hp BMW 801 D-2, further enhancing the performance of the aircraft. Additionally, the two 7.92mm MG 17s in the wing routes were replaced by two MG 151/20E 20mm cannons. Subsequent variants differed only in the specific gun models used and quality of life changes. Over 10,000 'Antons' were built by the end of the war."

    ger_fighter_equipment_8_desc:0 "The D-9 was the only mass-produced 'Dora' model. The airframe was completely redesigned around the powerful Jumo 213 A-1, which could produce up to 2,071hp at takeoff with the special injection system MW50. The D-9 had the same armament as the F-8 with two 13mm MG 131 heavy machine guns mounted above the engine and two 20mm MG151/20E cannons mounted in the wing routes. About 1400 were built in total from August 1944 to April 1945."

    ger_fighter_equipment_9_desc:0 "Designed as a high-altitude interceptor to counter American bombing raids, the Ta-152 H outclassed every allied fighter above 10km. The aircraft is essentially a Fw-190 D-9 that has longer wings, a more powerful Jumo 213 E-1 engine, and a single nose-mounted 30mm MK 108 cannon instead of the two 13mm MG 131s. However, it came too late to have any significant impact on the war."

Mounted in the nose were two 20mm MG FF cannons and four 7.92mm MG 17 machine guns, packing a formidable punch even by late-war standards, but the single rear-mounted 7.92mm MG 15 was inadequate for air defense purposes. Furthermore, the delay of the DB 600 engines forced Bayrische Flugwerke to use Jumo 210G engines instead, leaving the aircraft severely underpowered."

It was exceptional at intercepting and shooting down British bombers over the Reich. During the Battle of Britain, Bf 110 were also temporarily used as long-range escorts as the Bf 109 lacked the range to escort German bombers effectively. This was dropped rather quickly after Bf 110s were found to lack the maneuver to keep up with enemy fighters, requiring their own escort of Bf 109s."
