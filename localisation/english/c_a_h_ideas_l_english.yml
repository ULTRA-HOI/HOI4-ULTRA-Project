GER_org_todt_rad_idea_desc:0 "\n§9Background§!\nWith the need to construct massive fortifications and infrastructure for the war effort, all available workforce is required. Conscripted, volunteer and forced workers equally are mobilised in their thousands by the Organisation Todt and the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD) to further the important projects of the Nazi government.\n§W---------------§!\n\n§tCrimes against Humanity§!\nDuring the war both Organisation Todt and the Reichsarbeitsdienst were intrumental in the exploitation of conquered territory and the fortifying of important locations.\nOT was heavily utilizing forced labour and thus deeply involved in the Holocaust by 'extermination through labour' as also execution of Holocaust victims, enslavement of foreign volunteer and conscripted workers and exploitation and killing of prisoners of war.\nThe RAD devolved from an employement-creation measure to a half-militarized force that trained recruits for the Wehrmacht and engaged in violent anti-partisan actions and executions behind the frontline.\nBoth organisations were disbanded and forbidden after the war and are to this day banned in Germany."
