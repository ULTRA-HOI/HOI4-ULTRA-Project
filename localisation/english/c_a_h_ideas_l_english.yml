GER_org_todt_rad_idea_desc:0 "\n§9Background§!\nWith the need to construct massive fortifications and infrastructure for the war effort, all available workforce is required. Conscripted, volunteer and forced workers equally are mobilised in their thousands by the Organisation Todt and the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD) to further the important projects of the Nazi government.\n§W---------------§!\n\n§tCrimes against Humanity§!\nDuring the war both Organisation Todt and the Reichsarbeitsdienst were instrumental in the exploitation of conquered territory and the fortifying of important locations.\nOT was heavily utilizing forced labour and thus deeply involved in the Holocaust by 'extermination through labour' as also execution of Holocaust victims, enslavement of foreign volunteer and conscripted workers and exploitation and killing of prisoners of war.\nThe RAD devolved from an employement-creation measure to a half-militarized force that trained recruits for the Wehrmacht and engaged in violent anti-partisan actions and executions behind the frontline.\nBoth organisations were disbanded and forbidden after the war and are to this day banned in Germany."

 GER_foreign_workers_reliance_desc:0 "\n§9Background§!\nWith ever more citizen being drafted, the German industry is running out of workers for its factories. Recognising this issue the General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment Fritz Sauckel has drafted a law forcing Vichy France to conscript young French for labour in Germany.\n§W---------------§!\n\n§tCrimes against Humanity§!\nFrench foreign workers conscripted under the Service du travail obligatoire laws (STO) were subjected to very bad working and housing conditions, badly supplied with food and often not given access to bomb shelters during Allied air raids. Consequently many died from illnesses, starvation and bombings.\nAfter the war Fritz Sauckel was found guilty of Crimes against Humanity during the Nuremberg trials, partially also due to the STO laws and their results, and sentenced to death by hanging. His ashes were dumped in the Wenzbach river.\nThe conscripted STO workers have been recognised as victims of forced labour and deportation, however never to the same degree as other groups."
