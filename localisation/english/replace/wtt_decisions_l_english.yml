 GER_mefo_bills_mission_desc:0 "In order to fund our growing military industry, and to keep this secret from British and French eyes, we have been forced to use a balance sheet entity to route payments to in the form of promissory notes. If we do not use our political connections to extend the due dates of these notes, we will be forced to repay them and will no longer receive their benefits."
 GER_mefo_bills_category_desc:0 "There have various ways of gearing up German economy for war. One of them is issuing MEFO bills, allowing to secretly fund rearmament.\n\nThe other is implementing Autarky, though this may lead to our economy collapsing if we can't secure infusion of new resources and capital."
