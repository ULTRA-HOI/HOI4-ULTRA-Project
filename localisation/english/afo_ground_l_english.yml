This lumbering behemoth of a supposed medium tank was put into service in 1936. As an utter failure, it was too heavy, too slow, the mixed armament was problematic in terms of ammunition storage, the vibrating chassis made precise aiming very difficult, its armor was far too thin for such a big vehicle and the additional MG turrets caused communication issues."
