### Features
- add a decision to manualy close steel mills / aluminium smelters
- integrate the newspaper mod (courtesy to their authors)
- add a distinction between "light infantry" and "front infantry" with the later using "heavy infantry equipment" in addition to regular infantry equipment. Light Infantry is faster, consume less suply and have good defensive capacities in rough terrain, but is less suited for the battlefield than its heavier counterpart.
- extended the artillery tree into the late 40's. Added heavy versions of artillerie, anti tank and anti air. Thoses cannot be used as frontline bataillon without being motorized. Most of arts and descriptions are placeholders from Vanilla, to be replaced later.
- Reintegrated wargoal on Fall Weiss and Barbarossa focuses. Allowing the player to do coordinated strike mission (from espionnage feature).

### Balance
