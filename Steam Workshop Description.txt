[h1]What is ULTRA?[/h1] 

   HOI4 ULTRA's goal is to give a historical feeling to Heart of Iron. Our ambition is to make the less changes as possible from the vanilla, but rather adapt it to a real historical balance and is meant to be played in Multiplayer.
The original goal was to give an historical repartition of the industry, but we decided to add/fix/tweak other contents we feel important.

[h1][b]Reasons to play or not to play ULTRA[/b] [/h1]

- You should [b]not[/b] play ULTRA if you want memes games
- You should [b]not[/b] play ULTRA if you want to world conquest with [insert irrelevant minor nation]

- You should play ULTRA if you want more historical immersion without changing the whole game 
- You should play ULTRA if you want a multiplayer game balanced toward History and realism
- You should play ULTRA if you want to feel the power of a major country during WWII

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]

HOI4 ULTRA is compatible with HOI4 1.10.2 version
NOT Ironman/achievement compatible
NOT compatible with any mod changing the checksum. If you want your favourite mod integrated, just ask it (and the mod creator too) and we'll see what we can do.

All current DLC (TFV, DOD, WTT, MTG, LaR) required for a complete experience. We cannot promise potential issues if you play without the required DLCs.

The alternative histories focus trees are supported but less develloped and tested than historical path

For the moment, only the english version is supported

[h1][b]Main feature - Industrial rebalance[/b][/h1]

  The primary objective of our work was to "correct" the industrial balance in the game : 
In vanilla, industry is balanced around "playability" and not around History. For the HOI4 devs team, each minor country should be "playable", the Axis should have a chance to "win", global conquest should be a possible achievment...

We don't agree with this view and want rather to play in a situation with historical settings concerning the relative power of each countries.

That's why we did a research work about the industry in the WWII timelapse in order to translate it into a mod. Our main sources are [u]The Wages of Destruction[/u] from  Adam Tooze and [u]The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers[/u] by Paul Kennedy.

From the later, we took the concept of "war potential" for each 1936 country and translate it into ingame industry (civilian, military and dockyard). To gives some figures, the 7 Great powers have more than 90% of the world IC and the gap between the last major power (Italy) and the first (the USA) is more than 1 to 10.
To have a better repartition, we made each vanilla IC equivalent to 2 IC in the mod.

To stay in the border of plausible, we also had to change 2 keys elements : the industrial growth rate (nerfing heavily industrial snowballing, we now get a growth rate under 10% per year in 1936) and the ressources system. Coal, Iron and Bauxite were added and globaly ressources are less expensive to get (depending of the ressource) to avoid overpowered minors from lots of ressources and majors having to trade away half of their industry.

[h1] Other features [/h1]

We tryed to keep things as close to vanilla as possible, so most of our work here are balance tweak for a more realist gameplay. Here is a list of some features we added or changed : 

- Combat width system (from 80 to 96 base width)
- Division designer (10 max support + 15 max line)
- Research and equipment balance
- Naval overhaul "Naval Rework" mod integrated
- Nation-uniques tanks from the mod "World Ablaze"
- Integration of some QoL mods 

[h1]Projects and perspectives [/h1]

Since we never test enough, we'll be pleased to hear your feedback and suggestions to improve the mod within the same philosophy.

Sub-modding is also encouraged if you want to integrate your favourite mod or create a feature inside the mod, you're welcome ;)

We plan to do an overhaul of the equipment and technologies to get major-unique stuff.
A french localization is scheduled. Perhaps a german one too. For the other langages, any help would be appreciated.

[h1]Partnership[/h1]

We are in partnership with the World Ablaze team. We share ideas, concepts and features. Make HOI4 more realistic is the main goal of both mod

We helped them to make their industrial balance and they gave us their awesome tank tree!

We learnt a lot from them, especially on research and equipment fields. Parts of the code of ULTRA (the whole tank tree and other features) are from their awesome work.
So a special thanks to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/]Uncharted[/url]!
